BestCRM exhaustive search for optimal Cis-Regulatory Modules


Here a novel method is presented, aimed to identify cis-regulatory elements in gene promoters based on the exhaustive search of all feasible modules configurations. All required parameters are utomatically estimated using positive and negative datasets. For computational efficiency the search is accelerated by using a multidimensional hash function, allowing the search within a few hours on a regular laptop. Tests on an established benchmark and real data show better performance of BestCRM over available methods. A great advantage of the method is the min-imum number of input parameters â€“ apart from positive and negative promoters only a desired level of module presence in promoters is required.
